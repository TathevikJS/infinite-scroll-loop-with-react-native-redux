# React Challenge

Here's the challenge.

Infinite scroll with React/redux :
* use [The Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/) to fetch data
* display a list of the most recent articles (title, date, section, short summary and thumbnail)
* when scrolling down the list, more articles are fetched and display automatically
* clic on an article displays the article itself, with a way to go back to the list

Rules :
* Basic UI but at least with a minimum of styling, no pure html. You can use any style library.
* Use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
* Use [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).
* No restrictions on googling.
* Of course don't copy/paste or get too much inspiration from anywhere.
* Should be completed in a few hours (no maximum imposed, it's up to you to decide when to stop, even if it's not finished).
* Merge requests are mandatory.
* Only push on git with SSH.
* Once completed update README.md with documentation and add how long it took to complete the challenge.

*Complited in 3.5 hours
